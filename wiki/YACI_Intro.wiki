= Future =

- Needs a big re-write instead of the hack that was used to allow for need support. Things I want to get done:

- use getopt in all scripts that take options

- make use of more subscripts that can be run standalone and do only one thing, and do it well

- allow for using kernel by default out of image, and it's modules

- allow for using kernel off of server and it's modules

- still provide a linux.org kernel, need to decide if this will still be static, or use modules.

- allow for images to be build for rpms and dpgk packages

- for rpms, allow image to be build from rpmlists and YUM repos
